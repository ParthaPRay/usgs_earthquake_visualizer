# USGS Earthquake Visualization Auto-Updater

**Interactive, real-time earthquake dashboard for global monitoring‚Äîpowered by the USGS Earthquake API. User-selectable time window, live fault lines, magnitude-coded markers, and full table view. 100% browser-based.**

---

## \:globe\_with\_meridians: Overview

This web application provides a real-time, interactive visualization of global earthquake activity, using authoritative live data from the [USGS (United States Geological Survey) Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/). Designed for both researchers and the general public, the app is suitable for education, industry, and rapid situational awareness.

## \:star2: Features

* **Live Earthquake Data:**
  Automatically fetches and displays recent earthquake events from the USGS API.
  Includes magnitude, precise location, depth, UTC timestamp, and a direct USGS event link.

* **User-Selectable Time Window:**
  Choose to view earthquakes from the last 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, up to 1 year.
  The dropdown instantly updates the map and table, so you can analyze trends at any scale.

* **Auto-Updating Visualization:**
  The dashboard automatically refreshes every 5 minutes, ensuring data is always current.
  No need to reload your browser manually.

* **Rich Interactive Map:**

  * **Markers clustered** for clarity; color-coded by Richter scale.
  * **Animated/blinking** marker for earthquakes in the last 5 minutes (real-time monitoring).
  * **Popup for each marker**: Magnitude, location, depth, time, and USGS reference.
  * **Fault lines overlay:** Tectonic plate boundaries are shown in purple for scientific context.

* **Dynamic Table Panel:**

  * Scrollable table lists all events in the current window, most recent at the top.
  * Columns: Magnitude, location (with details), time, and depth.
  * Magnitudes are color-coded for instant risk assessment.

* **Mobile Friendly & Responsive:**

  * Layout adapts for mobile and tablets.
  * No installation required‚Äîjust open the HTML file.

* **No Backend or Server Needed:**
  All computation and rendering happens in the browser. No dependencies other than a modern browser and Internet connection.

## \:rocket: Quick Start

**1. Download or clone this repository.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/usgs-earthquake-visualization.git
cd usgs-earthquake-visualization
```

**2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
*No build step required!*

**3. Select your preferred time window from the dropdown.**
*The map and table update instantly, and will auto-refresh every 5 minutes.*

## \:mag: How It Works

* **Data Source:**
  Live data is retrieved from the [USGS FDSN Event Web Service](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/), using a browser-based [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) request.

* **Map Engine:**
  Uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) for robust, scalable mapping.

* **Fault Lines:**
  Tectonic boundaries are overlaid using the [PB2002 plate boundary dataset](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).

* **Color Coding:**
  Magnitude bins (Richter scale) are visually mapped to marker colors:

  * Micro (0‚Äì2): Blue
  * Minor (2‚Äì3): Green
  * Light (3‚Äì4): Yellow
  * Moderate (4‚Äì5): Light Orange
  * Strong (5‚Äì6): Orange
  * Major (6‚Äì7): Red
  * Great (7+): Dark Red

* **Auto-Update:**
  A `setInterval` in JavaScript re-queries the API every 5 minutes, refreshing both map and table in-place.

## \:hammer\_and\_wrench: Dependencies

All dependencies are loaded via CDN, so you do **not** need to install anything.

* [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
* [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
* [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)
* [PB2002 Fault Lines GeoJSON](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)

## \:bulb: Usage Tips

* **Browser Support:**
  Works best in latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.

* **Map Controls:**

  * Click any marker for full details and USGS event link.
  * Zoom and pan the map to focus on any region.

* **API Limitations:**

  * USGS API allows up to 20,000 events per query; querying long periods (months/years) may not show every small quake.
  * The "Last 1 year" option may skip some minor events.

* **Customization:**

  * You can easily change the auto-update interval (default 5 min = 300000 ms).
  * Add/remove time window options by editing the `<select>` block in the HTML.

---

## \:warning: Troubleshooting

* **Map is blank:**
  Ensure you are online; the map and data are loaded live from the internet.

* **No data for short window:**
  Selecting a very short window (like 5 min) may show zero events if no earthquakes occurred.

* **API errors:**
  Occasionally, the USGS API may throttle requests or have temporary outages.

* **Mobile glitches:**
  For best results on mobile, view in landscape orientation.

---

## \:triangular\_ruler: Extensibility

* **Add new map layers** (e.g., aftershocks, tsunami zones) by modifying the JavaScript.
* **Integrate with other hazard APIs** (e.g., volcanoes, floods) for multi-risk dashboards.
* **Fork and build your own custom earthquake analytics platform!**
